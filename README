This repository contains the code accompanying my PyData 2013 talk, "How does
text become data?".

If you're seeing this on GitHub, try looking at the .md files. Otherwise try the
.html files under html/.

The code in src/ is meant to be run interactively in an IPython Notebook.  The
.py versions of the files, though, will run in ordinary Python, and just have
oddly-formatted comments from IPython that you can disregard.
