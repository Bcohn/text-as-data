This repository contains the code accompanying my talk, "How does text become
data?", presented in various forms at PyData 2013 and Strange Loop 2013.

To see the code and its output as it appeared during the talk, you can click
on any of the .md files on GitHub. Or, if you've downloaded this repository,
you can look at the .html files.

The "src" directory contains the actual code. The .ipynb files are the
interactive IPython notebooks.  The .py versions of the files will run in
ordinary Python, and just have oddly-formatted comments from IPython that you
can disregard.
