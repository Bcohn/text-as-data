This repository contains the code accompanying my PyData 2013 talk, "How does
text become data?".

Here you can see HTML pages that represent what I showed on the screen. In the
src/ directory you'll find the Python code (with comments from IPython that you
can disregard), and the IPython notebook files themselves.

The code is meant to be run interactively in an IPython Notebook. The .py
versions of the files, though, will run in ordinary Python, and just have
oddly-formatted comments from IPython that you can disregard.
