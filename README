This repository contains the code accompanying my PyData 2013 talk, "How does
text become data?".

The code is meant to be run interactively in an IPython Notebook. The .py
versions of the files, though, will run in ordinary Python, and just have
oddly-formatted comments from IPython that you can disregard.
