        "(' \" stuart little \" is one of the best family films to come out this year . \\nit\\'s a cute , funny and very good-natured film that has nothing for parents to squirm over except a few mild cusswords . \\nthough i read the book a long time ago and i really do not remember what it was about , i do know that this film does not disappoint . \\nfinally a movie gets released that is as good as the trailer makes it to be , with a few surprising twists , some very funny moments , and a few sentimental moments all mixed in to one great little movie . \\nstuart little is a mouse . \\nhe has finally gotten a new home after being put up for adoption , he now lives with the littles . \\na nice little ( no pun intended ) family that lives in their apartment next to central park in new york city . \\nthey have a little boy george ( played by the adorable jonathan lipnicki ) and now they have a new son . \\nat first stuart takes a while but he finally adjusts to being part of the family and even getting along with the pet cat . \\ngeorge doesn\\'t take too well to having a mouse for a brother at first , but once the two play together they instantly bond . \\nstuart however is missing something , and he wants to know who his real parents are . \\nthe littles try and find his parents and one day they show up on the doorstep wanting stuart back . \\nhesitating the littles know what\\'s best for stuart and so does snowball the pet cat , he and his friends try to get stuart but in the end we find out the truth about stuart\\'s past ending up to a sentimental and very heart-warming ending . \\none thing i noticed about the film instantly was the fantastic special effects . \\njust like in \" star wars : episode 1--the phantom menace \" stuart little and his family are all computer generated and they look fantastically real . \\nfrom the detail of their fur , to the detail of the way the walk ; the special effects team put a lot of time and effort on this $90 million dollar film and it shows . \\nanother movie that this has in common with is \" babe \" with it\\'s talking animals and people understanding them . \\nit has a family friendly atmosphere and is never really scary or suspenseful enough to even scare the youngest of kids . \\nmichael j . fox does the voice of stuart himself and just like in the \" homeward bound \" movies does a fantastic job and brings more out of stuart than anyone else could . \\nhe to me fits the character perfectly and ends up making stuart even more lovable . \\nanother gem of the film is nathan lane as snowball . \\nwhen he was timon in 1994\\'s \" the lion king \" i would have sworn he was a comedian , and now in \" stuart little \" he brings the most out of snowball and makes him one of those characters we love to dislike . \\nfor the human actors geena davis who never gives a bad performance does not disappoint here as well . \\nshe fits nicely in her character and there is a good chemistry between her and hugh laurie who plays mr . little . \\nboth make us believe they are happily in love and married and jonathan lipnicki as their song is even more adorable than he was in 1996\\'s \" jerry maguire \" . \\neven though stuart little is completely cgi , the human characters and stuart have a nice chemistry together and even makes us believe they really do care for each other . \\n \" stuart little \" is ideal family entertainment for this holiday season and will not disappoint youngsters or adults for that matter . \\nwe get entertainment , laughs , cries and more fun at the movies this season than probably any other movie . \\nits nice to see a pg rated movie out at christmas that everyone can see . \\neven though it has a $90 million dollar budget i\\'m sure it will make over that or just below it respectively . \\nfor all you parents out there trying to find a good family movie , i have yet to see bicentennial man as i write this but as far as i know \" stuart little \" and \" toy story 2 \" are by far the best family films this year . \\na winner . ? \\n',\n",
